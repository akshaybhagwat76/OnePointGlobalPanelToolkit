Only one of the tick boxes should be allowed to be ticked not both, currently both can be ticked. 
Its one or the other and this applies to both forms. Also the error message isn't appearing if nothing is ticked and it should be? 

Where these forms trigger an email with the details in, please can you add to the email the new information from the tick boxes so,
 If box 1 is ticked - the email should say:
'Full GDPR consent given: YES',
'Consent Given for this Request only: NO'

but if the first box isn't ticked and the second one is the email needs to say:
'Full GDPR consent given: NO'
'Consent Given for this Request only: YES
